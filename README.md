<h1>Learning Log</h1>

The first time when I tried the Arduino, I was so overwhelmed by a lot of high-tech looking components. But it wasn't some sort of rocket science. 
I found out the usage of all the components in the box from the youtube video and I did simulation by using the TinkerCAD circuit simulator.

Based on the understanding of the whole mechanism and simulating, I could make a basic form one. Also, I made a variation form which is keeping lights on by connecting the LED bulbs to power without a button.

The way I see it, physical computing can be a very interactive method with the audience, and the parts that I worked on are quite simple but I could say physical computing(Arduino) is feeling like a very early version of nowadays high technology.

<h2><em>No Worries</em></h2>


Do you want to crash the <strong>ARDUINO</strong> and go home?

Before seeking a hammer, let's check just<strong>*two things</strong>

<h3><strong>*GND</strong></h3> 
Isn't your jumper wire ( <em>the wire that is supposed to be connected to 'GND (ground)'</em> ) connected to 'Vin'?


<h3><strong>*LED's legs</strong></h3>
Let's see the LED bulb, it has two legs, 

1.<strong>short one</strong> (<em>It's called 'cathos' and It connects to ground</em>)

2.<strong>long one</strong> (<em>It's called 'anods' and It connects to power</em>)



I recommend you to try the TinkerCAD circuit simulator and watch the youtube video.

<h1>Thoughts on the filed of computing</h1>
  
Physical computing, code, digitalized working method... all these things are heard a little bit heavy to easily embrace and do. But, as the market is changing and moving even right now, plus, the audiences' (or 'consumer') needs are getting more complex, I believe we should be ready for the upcoming future. Also, at the same time, we shouldn't forget the most crucial fact that there is a human behind everything eventually.
