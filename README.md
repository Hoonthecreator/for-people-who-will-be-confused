Do you want to crash the <strong>ARDUINO</strong> and go home?

Before seeking a hammer, let's check <strong>*two things</strong>

<h3><strong>*GND</strong></h3>
Isn't your jumper wire ( <em>the wire that is supposed to be connected to 'GND (ground)'</em> ) connected to 'Vin'?


<h3><strong>*LED's legs</strong></h3>

<strong>short one</strong> (<em>It's called 'cathos' and It connects to ground</em>)

and <strong>long one</strong> (<em>It's called 'anods' and It connects to power</em>)

* I recommend you to try the TinkerCAD circuit simulator and watch the youtube video.
