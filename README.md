<h1>Learning Log</h1>

The first time when I tried the Arduino, I was so overwhelmed by a lot of high-tech looking components. But it wasn't some sort of rocket science. 
I found out the usage of all the components in the box from the youtube video and I did simulation by using the TinkerCAD circuit simulator.

<h2><em>No Worries</em></h2>

<p>This READ.ME file is published for people who will be so confused :joy: ðŸ˜¢.</p>
Do you want to crash the <strong>ARDUINO</strong> and go home?

Before seeking a hammer, let's check <strong>*two things</strong>

<h3><strong>*GND</strong></h3> 
Isn't your jumper wire ( <em>the wire that is supposed to be connected to 'GND (ground)'</em> ) connected to 'Vin'?


<h3><strong>*LED's legs</strong></h3>
Let's see the LED bulb, it has two legs, 

- <strong>short one</strong> (<em>It's called 'cathos' and It connects to ground</em>)

- <strong>long one</strong> (<em>It's called 'anods' and It connects to power</em>)


I recommend you to try the TinkerCAD circuit simulator and watch the youtube video.
